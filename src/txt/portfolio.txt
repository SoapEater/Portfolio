Robco Industries System Log - About this portfolio:<br><br>

"A few months after graduating, I decided to finally create a portfolio.
Initially, I planned to go with a generic and simple design, but I scrapped that idea because it felt too boring.
While job hunting on LinkedIn and Indeed, I spent some of my free time playing video games.
One that caught my attention was Fallout: New Vegas.
For years, I had ignored this game, and I ended up regretting that decision.<br><br>

After a few weeks, I became completely immersed in its buggy charm and incredible storytelling.
I never expected a game to hit me with such an existential dilemma. NCR, Legion, Mr. House, or Yes Man ending? Woah, hold onâ€”I thought my goal was to find the guy who shot me, not decide the fate of everyone in the Mojave Wasteland!<br><br>
After my random escapades in Fallout: New Vegas, I returned to my portfolio with fresh inspiration.
I decided to design it based on the RobCo Termlink interface, blending my creativity with a nod to one of my favorite gaming experiences."<br><br>
